Week 6 update for Expression WED (With Error Detection):

This update, annotated with filename buildParseTreeWED.py requires use of two modules, the matching updated binaryTreeWED.py, and the non updated doublyLinkedStack.py. Together the two undated files provide a With Error Detection capability to provide a low level expression error detection capability for items such as redundant parenthesis or other errors that make an expression
not proper or incorrect.

This updated buildParseTreeWED.py will generate a helper file to the same directory or folder these files are in called
errorDetection.txt that is a temp or bufferthat will overwrite each run. You do not need it to start, it will create and update as needed.

Files for this are buildParseTreeWED.py, binaryTreeWED.py, and doublyLinkedStack.py. Only the first two with WED in the name are updates. Video addendum created and going to canvas with the files for the new code. Old video addresses the core code without the WED functionality.

Week 6:
Clean up to provide a more robust demonstration. Significant changes: final print output was a call to expression converter and I replaced that with a call to print expression by extracting  the data out of the parse tree and printing each element along with parens and spaces. Added a rodeo expression for demo in the video and cleaned up some commenting. supports a better and timely review of the binary tree file with focus on post order traversal, post order evaluation, and print expression (inorder). Updated video completed and will be provided to canvas. 
week6 - PE1 and PE2: binary_heap.py
week6 - PE3: buildParseTree.py, binaryTree.py, and doublyLinkedStack.py

Here are the files. I have 4 videos and am having a hardware failure for the video card 
so it will no longer capture the screen and make videos. I have 3 done and hash table no 
video and may need a new computer or a repair. I will load the .py files and3 videos to 
canvas and if I can get an alternative computer timely make the last video. Mike
