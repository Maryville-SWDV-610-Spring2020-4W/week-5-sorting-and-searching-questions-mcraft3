I updated the demo on line 364, 365 and 366 to usekey35 and value pig to match the previous update to replace key 55 with 35. By doing that an above demo of  .put of key forces a rehash. Previously do to the resize function there was no actual demonstration of resize so I updated a few keys to show the rehash. I forget to update these 3 demo lines to now use key 35 as key 55 no longer existed. This makes all the demo work properly. There was no change to the hash table code it is good and runs good. v/r Mike

Here are the files. I have 4 videos and am having a hardware failure for the video card 
so it will no longer capture the screen and make videos. I have 3 done and hash table no 
video and may need a new computer or a repair. I will load the .py files and3 videos to 
canvas and if I can get an alternative computer timely make the last video. Mike
