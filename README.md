Clean up to provide a more robust demonstration. Significant changes: final print output was a call to expression converter and I replaced that with a call to print expression by extracting  the data out of the parse tree and printing each element along with parens and spaces. Added a rodeo expression for demo in the video and cleaned up some commenting. supports a better and timely review of the binary tree file with focus on post order traversal, post order evaluation, and print expression (inorder). Updated video completed and will be provided to canvas. v/r Mike

Here are the files. I have 4 videos and am having a hardware failure for the video card 
so it will no longer capture the screen and make videos. I have 3 done and hash table no 
video and may need a new computer or a repair. I will load the .py files and3 videos to 
canvas and if I can get an alternative computer timely make the last video. Mike
